<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Task A1
### Goal
"1. To add one checkpoint for each cost intensive area(2 in total) 2. To reach all checkpoints before arriving at the destination."

### Background
"The primary goal is to deliver essential supplies to two separate locations. These supplies could range from medical and food supplies to technical equipment or humanitarian aid. Precise planning is essential, involving precise calculations for fuel, timing, and the safest and most efficient routes to reach the drop-off points and return to base. The primary mission of the supply craft is the swift and efficient delivery of crucial supplies to two high-priority, cost-intensive areas. Central to this mission is the strategic route planning, which focuses on creating the most direct and practical path between these checkpoints. This optimized routing is key to minimizing travel time and fuel consumption, ensuring the prompt delivery of essential items like medical and food supplies, and technical or humanitarian aid."

### Methodology 
"In the given scenario from Task 1, our objective is to refine an existing pathfinding algorithm to automatically incorporate two designated checkpoints within cost-intensive areas. Modify our pathfinding algorithm to include these checkpoints as required waypoints. Once the optimal route is calculated, it should be visualized on the graph. This typically involves plotting the route over a map or graph, with checkpoints and cost-intensive areas clearly marked."
